# chalice-htmx-alpine-jinja2-demo

This is a demo of a simple Chalice app that uses HTMX, Alpine, and Jinja2. It's a simple app that allows you
            to
            view the data from the [JSONPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API</a>. The data is
            fetched
            from the API using HTMX and then rendered using Jinja2.
